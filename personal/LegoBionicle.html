            Lego Bionicle was Lego next line of conscrutable actifigure or constraction for short. Realease in 2001 and test in some markets even before then. As the people saw this new Lego it became a instant clasic. This theam ran for ten years. This set was also the first lego theam that had a story, with its comics being one of the most popular and wide spread during its time. With each year that came out we will learn more about the world we didnt even know we wanted. This theme last for ten years, with that we had alot of lore that was spread over many diferent things. The toys, comics, and the cerals where what got people into this theme. I have to mention something that is relivent to this theme. Lego Bionicle your brother Lego Hero Factory. This set was a way to make things simpler and better to understand. Here there was just the main cast there was hunderes of them you could build your own hero. And give your own name and ablites. In Hero Factory wave two Ordeal of Fire the Charter Creatcher Building System was a upgrade that helped to brodend your imagination with making your own heros and villians.

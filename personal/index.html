            Lego Bionicle and Skylanders played a very important role in my life. I was about 11 Lego and Skylander was something I wanted for my birthday and Chirstmas. One of my birthday I got some thing that I didnt like. So I ask if I could return them and get something that I realy like. I went to the Skylander aera and didnt find anything. But one of the employees said to check at the return center. And I found me my favorit fire skylander Sunburn. And the Adventure pack that came with it. I got home and imdeaitly started to play the Adventure pack level that it came with. And I 100% the level as soon as I could. During the same year I was ask by my grandparnets what would I like for Chirstmas. I showed them that I wanted a Lego Bionicle. And on Christmas eve party my grandparnets gave me a present and in it was, the lego Bioncle set you see int he image. I put it together whith in the next few days. I eventualy got all the others sets I now have. The Story and toys of Bioncle is something that new Lego set lack. I hope that one day the new generation can experaince the joy of Lego Bionicle.
